# RF Transimpedance Amplifier

An AC-coupled transimpedance amplifier, for use in (eg) beatnote or PDH locks.

Still a work in progress, more info to come soon.

NOTE: Despite git commit history, the pdh-photodiode branch is more up to date than master for the ac-coupled transimpedance amp (I believe...)
