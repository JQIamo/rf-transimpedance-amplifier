<h1>RF Transimpedance Amplifier</h1>
<p>Transimpedance amplifier for RF photodiode signals. Designed to operate at the shot noise limit.</p>

<p>For signals which require a DC component, use a different circuit!</p>

<p>Mounting: This board will fit inside a standard SM1 lens tube from Thorlabs.
You will also need the auxiliary power board, which also fits in an SM1 mount,
and does filtering/line regulation from +15V. The two are jumpered together 
using UMC cable.
